    <p>Currently, it is only possible to choose a legacy contact for your main profile, not for your additional Facebook profiles. You can either designate a legacy contact who will manage your main memorial profile, or permanently delete your account from Facebook.
        A legacy contact is someone you choose to manage your primary profile if it becomes a memorial profile after your death. If you add a legacy contact, that person will be able to make decisions about your primary profile once it becomes a memorial profile.</p>
